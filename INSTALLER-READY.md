## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING (FOR USERS)

### "Windows protected your PC" message
- Click **"More info"**
- Click **"Run anyway"**
- This happens because the app isn't digitally signed (normal for free distribution)

### Application won't start
- Make sure they extracted the entire folder (not just the .exe)
- The app/ and runtime/ folders must be in the same location as Type-Jam.exe

### Antivirus blocks the file
- Add an exception in antivirus settings
- This is common for unsigned applications
